CDB_cycles_AnalysisOfParameters
================

In this notebook, we are studying the different parameters of our method
Complexity Driven Bagging so as to offer a range of selection to the
final user. In particular, we have three parameters:

-   Split: the number of splits in which we cut the complexity spectrum.
    s=1 implies we are training with one easy sample, one uniform sample
    and one hard sample. That is, the cycle length is 3. s=2 implies 6
    samples of different complexity (cycle length is 6).

-   Alpha: to give more weight to the easiest and the hardest instances
    in the bootstrap sampling procedure with the aim of training the
    classifier with samples of higher or lower complexity (thus,
    enlarging the original range of complexity).

-   Number of cycles. How many times the procedure is repeated. This is
    totally related with the final number of ensembles.

Besides this 3 parameters, we have obtained results for different
complexity measures. For the analysis of the parameters, we have
aggregated results over the different complexity measures.

First, we are studying the recommended number of cycles. That is, given
a value of split and a value of alpha, we want to know when the best
accuracy is obtained, when there are significant differences, etc. so as
to recommend the lower number of cycles (lower number of ensembles) with
the best performance.

Once the number of cycles is reduced, we perform a similar analysis on
the alpha parameter and the on the split parameter.

The higher the value of split, the higher the mean (with some
exceptions) of accuracy, the lower the median and the lower the standard
deviation. ¿Medium-low split values?

The higher the value of alpha, the lower the mean and the median of
accuracy. The standard deviation keeps lower for low-medium values. –\>
Low-medium values of alpha. Lower than 12.

### Mean, median and standard deviation of accuracy for all levels of n_cycles (for some split values)

We cannot perform a summary of ‘n_cycle’ in general because the number
of cycles depends on the value of split. Thus, we show some cases.

**split = 1**

``` r
table_split1 <- datos %>% filter(split == 1) %>%
  group_by(n_cycle) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(accuracy_mean_mean),  list(mean = mean, median = median, std = sd))
#knitr::kable(table_split1)

datatable(table_split1)
```
