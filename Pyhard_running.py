#### How to run
# In terminal: pyhard run # to obtain all results, then metadata_full.csv contains all the complexity measures
# In terminal: pyhard run --no-isa # to obtain complexity measures results without model information,
# then metadata.csv is the file of interest


### DOUBTS:
## How to automatically execute the code for several datasets?
## How to select the path where the results are saved?
